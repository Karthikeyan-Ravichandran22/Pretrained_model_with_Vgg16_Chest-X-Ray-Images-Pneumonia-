# Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Kaggle project

This project is based on the Kaggle dataset [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), which contains 5,863 X-Ray images of chest scans of patients with and without pneumonia. The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can classify the images into two categories: normal or pneumonia.

## Model

The model used in this project is a pretrained VGG16 model from Keras, which is a convolutional neural network that has been trained on the ImageNet dataset. The VGG16 model has 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The model takes an input image of size 224 x 224 x 3 and outputs a vector of 1000 probabilities for different classes.

To adapt the VGG16 model to the chest X-ray images, the following steps were taken:

- The last fully connected layer of the VGG16 model was removed, and a new fully connected layer with two units and a softmax activation function was added. This layer outputs a vector of two probabilities for the normal and pneumonia classes.
- The weights of the VGG16 model were frozen, except for the last four convolutional layers and the new fully connected layer. This means that only these layers were trained on the chest X-ray images, while the rest of the layers kept their pretrained weights from ImageNet.
- The images were resized to 224 x 224 x 3 and normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the ImageNet dataset.
- Data augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, rotation, zooming, and shifting were applied to the training images to increase the diversity and robustness of the model.

## Training

The model was trained on a subset of 4,224 images from the Kaggle dataset, with 80% of the images used for training and 20% for validation. The model was trained for 20 epochs, with a batch size of 32 and an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. The model achieved a validation accuracy of 89.9% and a validation loss of 0.28.

## Testing

The model was tested on a separate subset of 624 images from the Kaggle dataset, with 50% of the images belonging to the normal class and 50% to the pneumonia class. The model achieved a test accuracy of 88.1% and a test loss of 0.33. The model also produced a confusion matrix and a classification report, which can be seen below:

|              | Normal | Pneumonia |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Normal       | 196    | 38        |
| Pneumonia    | 37     | 353       |

|              | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Normal       | 0.84      | 0.84   | 0.84     | 234     |
| Pneumonia    | 0.90      | 0.91   | 0.90     | 390     |
| Accuracy     |           |        | 0.88     | 624     |
| Macro avg    | 0.87      | 0.87   | 0.87     | 624     |
| Weighted avg | 0.88      | 0.88   | 0.88     | 624     |

## Conclusion

The pretrained VGG16 model was able to achieve a high accuracy and a low loss on the chest X-ray images, demonstrating its ability to transfer its knowledge from ImageNet to a different domain. The model was able to distinguish between normal and pneumonia images with a high precision and recall, indicating its reliability and usefulness for medical diagnosis. However, the model also had some limitations, such as the small size and imbalance of the dataset, the lack of clinical information and labels, and the possibility of overfitting and generalization errors. Therefore, further improvements and validations are needed before applying the model to real-world scenarios.
